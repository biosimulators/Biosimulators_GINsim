Tutorial
========

BioSimulators-GINsim is available as a command-line program and as a command-line program encapsulated into a Docker image.


Creating COMBINE/OMEX archives and encoding simulation experiments into SED-ML
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information about how to create COMBINE/OMEX archives which can be executed by BioSimulators-GINsim is available `here <`https://docs.biosimulations.org/users/creating-projects/>`_.

A list of the algorithms and algorithm parameters supported by GINsim is available at `BioSimulators <https://biosimulators.org/simulators/ginsim>`_.

Models (SBML-qual)
++++++++++++++++++

BioSimulators-GINsim can execute models encoded in the ``qual`` package of SBML and GINsim's format (zginml).

Simulation experiments (SED-ML, KISAO)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

BioSimulators-GINsim can execute simulation experiments encoded in SED-ML, using KiSAO to indicate specific algorithms and their parameters. Information about the algorithms (KiSAO terms), algorithm parameters (KiSAO terms), and outputs (XML XPaths for variables) supported by BioSimulators-GINsim is available from the `BioSimulators registry <https://biosimulators.org/simulators/ginsim>`_.

Example COMBINE/OMEX archives
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Examples of COMBINE/OMEX archives for logical simulations which BioSimulators-GINsim can execute are available in the `BioSimulators test suite <https://github.com/biosimulators/Biosimulators_test_suite/tree/deploy/examples>`_.


Command-line program
--------------------

The command-line program can be used to execute COMBINE/OMEX archives that describe simulations as illustrated below.

.. code-block:: text

    usage: biosimulators-ginsim [-h] [-d] [-q] -i ARCHIVE [-o OUT_DIR] [-v]

    BioSimulators-compliant command-line interface to the GINsim <http://ginsim.org/> simulation program.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -d, --debug           full application debug mode
      -q, --quiet           suppress all console output
      -i ARCHIVE, --archive ARCHIVE
                            Path to OMEX file which contains one or more SED-ML-
                            encoded simulation experiments
      -o OUT_DIR, --out-dir OUT_DIR
                            Directory to save outputs
      -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

For example, the following command could be used to execute the simulations described in ``./modeling-study.omex`` and save their results to ``./``:

.. code-block:: text

    biosimulators-ginsim -i ./modeling-study.omex -o ./


Docker image with a command-line entrypoint
-------------------------------------------

The entrypoint to the Docker image supports the same command-line interface described above.

For example, the following command could be used to use the Docker image to execute the same simulations described in ``./modeling-study.omex`` and save their results to ``./``:

.. code-block:: text

    docker run \
        --tty \
        --rm \
        --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd),target=/tmp/working-dir \
        ghcr.io/biosimulators/ginsim:latest \
            -i /tmp/working-dir/modeling-study.omex \
            -o /tmp/working-dir
